        <h2>Day 1 – Creating Sports Visual Graphics</h2>
      <p class="date">February 22, 2026</p>
      <p>I created several graphic designs that I can show in my portfolio to add some sample projects on my portfolio. 
        Some designs didn’t turn out the way I expected, but I tried my best to make each one as good as possible.

       <h2>Day 2 – Planning of the Project </h2>
        <p class="date">February 23 , 2026</p>
        <p> Today we focused on planning the structure of the project and organizing its layout to create a clearer 
        and more efficient development process.</p>

       <h2>Day 3 – Starting the Project </h2>
        <p class="date">February 24, 2026</p>
        <p> We cloned our repository and set up the project structure. It was my first time using Git/GitHub so I was 
        confused especially using git commands. The good thing was I have a team that helped me navigate
         through the different processes. Because of this experience, I gained a better understanding of how to organize files 
         efficiently and use Git more effectively.</p>

    <p class="date">February 25-26, 2026</p>
    <p>
        This day was set to be our coding day. We started building the structure of our pages and applying basic 
        styles using HTML and CSS.
