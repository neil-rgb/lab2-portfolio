        <h2>Day 1 – Designing Sports Visuals</h2>
      <p class="date">February 22, 2026</p>
      <p>Today I worked on designing a few sports visuals and tested different layouts to see what looked stronger. 
        Some designs didn’t turn out the way I expected, so I had to adjust the spacing and colors several times.
         It took longer than planned, but I learned how small details can really change the overall impact.

        <p> Today we focused on planning the structure of the project and organizing its layout to create a clearer 
        and more efficient development process.</p>

       <h2>Day 3 – Starting the Project </h2>
        <p class="date">February 24, 2026</p>
        <p> Today we cloned our repository and set up the project structure. It was my first time using Git/GitHub so I was sketchy at first but my team guided me so then 
            I gained a better understanding of how to organize files efficiently and use Git more effectively.</p>

    <h2>Day 4/5 – Coding Day</h2>
    <p class="date">February 25-26, 2026</p>
    <p>
        Today was our coding day. We started building the structure of our pages and applying basic styles using HTML and CSS. There were moments when things didn’t work as expected, but after debugging and adjusting the code, I understood better how layout and styling connect.
