    <h2>Day 3 – February 26, 2026</h2>
    <p>
        Today, I finalized my portfolio layout and updated my blog links
        to include multiple daily entries. I also reviewed our repository
        structure and ensured that my commits were properly documented.
        This helped me become more confident in using Git for collaboration.
